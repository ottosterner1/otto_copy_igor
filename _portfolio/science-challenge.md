## Background

The year is 2023 and the place is the Imperial College Department of Artificial Intelligence. We follow a PhD student looking to get to the bottom of a question posed by his supervisor: “How will A.I.s turn art into science?” Previous generations of students might have poured over books for night after caffeine-filled night in an attempt to come up with some sort of answer. 

This student, however, took an entirely different path. 

The student we follow has specialised in the latest Deep Learning techniques, has allocated run-time on the latest supercomputers and is also a part of a select experimental group with access to a meta-program on the first functional quantum computer. This program is capable of outputting a machine’s own perspective within a Deep Learning algorithm. Or so the humans believe. 

Using the latest Deep Learning Manifold Algorithm, the A.I. is asked the topic question at 6 depth-levels on a supercomputer, with insight provided by the quantum computer meta-program.

It transcends space and time and is instead weaved directly into the core of life. A primary demonstration of the timeless nature of art is the nostalgic properties of music.  <br /><br />Music is one of the oldest forms of art and it gave respite from the harsh world of survival to our ancestors. Music has the power to transport the listener to an alternate reality.  <br /><br />Through hardship, the relief art provides is invaluable.
